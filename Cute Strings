/*A string S of length 3 is called cute if it satisfies the following conditions: 
S1=S3, i.e. its first and last characters are equal, and
S2=w, i.e. its middle character is w.
Some examples of cute strings are "owo", "uwu", and "qwq"; whereas "wwf" and "oco" are examples of strings that are not cute.

You are given a string S of length 3. Is it cute?

Each character of S is a lowercase English letter, i.e. one of
