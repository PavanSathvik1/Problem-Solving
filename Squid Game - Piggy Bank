/* In the deadly "Squid Game," the participants start with N players. After the game ends, only K players survive. The prize pool increases based on the number of players eliminated.

Each eliminated player contributes a fixed amount of 10,000 units to the prize pool.

Your task is to calculate the total prize money added to the pool, given the number of players N at the start of the game and the number of players who survive, K.

Input Format
The first line contains two integers 
N and K, where:
N is the total number of players at the start of the game.
K is the number of players still alive after the game.
Output Format
Print a single integer — the total prize money added to the pool.

Constraints
